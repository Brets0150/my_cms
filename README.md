# DC-XP Tracker

GOAL: 
This tool is designed for both tracks, rewarded, and provide feedback about Support Technicians quality of work. The intent is to incentivize Techs to go the extra mile and get every detail correct the first time. While at the same time encourage friendly competition. 

How It Works: 
On a monthly basis, there is money put into the "Cash Pool". Over the month Techs submit the "Jobs" they have performed for XP points. This is called an "XP Request". The request process is made quick and simple to not add more, unnecessary work. 
Since there is generally a manager overseeing Techs and reviewing there work in tickets anyways, this tool works to integrate itself with this process. The Manager / Admin has an "XP Review" panel they can be used to review tickets Techs have submitted, and quickly Approve/Deny and provide feedback to the Tech about there performance.
